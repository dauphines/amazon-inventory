# Amazon Inventory Clone

This repo is a clone of Amazon's inventory service. It is meant to handle vendor’s fulfilling inventory orders, adding a new item to inventory, handling client’s request for item detailed information, and purchasing items.

This service generates all application data needed to answer the question:

On a week by week basis, do users who spend more than $100 on products at the time of Prime membership signup convert to a full Prime membership more often than those who spend less than $100?
